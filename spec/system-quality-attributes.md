# 🏗️ System Quality Attributes

This document outlines the key quality attributes that guide the design and implementation of the Structured Annotation System built on ATProto.

---

## 📋 System Overview

The Structured Annotation System enables users to create, share, and discover rich, structured annotations for web content using the ATProto network. Users sign in with their Bluesky accounts and publish annotations to their personal repositories, leveraging the decentralized nature of ATProto for data ownership and social discovery.

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### Authentication
- **Bluesky Integration**: Users authenticate via their Bluesky accounts, leveraging ATProto's authentication mechanisms.
- **Session Management**: Secure handling of authentication tokens with proper refresh mechanisms.

### Privacy
- **User Control**: Users maintain control over their annotations through ATProto's permission model.
- **Visibility Options**: Support for public, unlisted, and private annotations.
- **Data Ownership**: Users own their data in their personal repositories on their PDS.

---

## 🔄 Interoperability

### ATProto Compliance
- **Lexicon Adherence**: All data structures conform to ATProto lexicon specifications.
- **Protocol Compatibility**: Full compatibility with ATProto client libraries and services.

### Web Standards
- **Browser Extension**: Cross-browser compatibility for the annotation extension.
- **Web Content**: Support for annotating diverse web content formats.

---

## 📈 Scalability

### Distributed Architecture
- **Decentralized Storage**: Leverages ATProto's distributed repository model.
- **Federation**: Benefits from ATProto's federated network for discovery and distribution.

### Performance Optimization
- **Local Caching**: Caches frequently accessed data to reduce network requests.
- **Lazy Loading**: Implements lazy loading for annotation content in collections.

---

## 🔍 Discoverability

### Social Features
- **Following**: Users can follow others to see their annotations.
- **Feeds**: Custom feeds based on followed users, topics, or domains.

### Search Capabilities
- **Tag-based Search**: Find annotations by tags across the network.
- **Domain Search**: Discover annotations for specific websites or domains.
- **Content Search**: Search within annotation content and evaluations.

---

## 🧩 Extensibility

### Template System
- **Custom Templates**: Users can create and share annotation templates.
- **Template Evolution**: Support for versioning and extending templates.

### Integration Points
- **API Access**: Well-defined interfaces for third-party integration.
- **Event Hooks**: Extensible event system for plugins and extensions.

---

## 🚀 Performance

### Response Time
- **Annotation Creation**: Sub-second response time for creating annotations.
- **Annotation Retrieval**: Fast loading of annotations for annotated pages.

### Resource Utilization
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Optimized data transfer with the ATProto network.
- **Client-side Processing**: Balanced workload between client and server.

---

## 🔄 Reliability

### Data Persistence
- **ATProto Durability**: Leverages ATProto's data persistence guarantees.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles concurrent edits and network partitions.

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintains core functionality during partial outages.
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Implements intelligent retry for network operations.

---

## 🧪 Testability

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive testing of domain logic.
- **Integration Testing**: Tests for ATProto integration points.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Browser extension and web application testing.

### Monitoring
- **Usage Analytics**: Anonymous usage patterns for improving the system.
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error logging and analysis.

---

## 🌐 Usability

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Interface**: Simple, context-aware annotation creation.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features revealed as needed.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance for core functionality.

### Feedback Loops
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate feedback on annotation actions.
- **Social Signals**: Visibility of reactions and interactions.
